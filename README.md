### TODOS
Here is a few of the things that i would like to improve / fix :).
* Warnings popping up in the console related to CSS styling (And other warnings that may appear).
* Remove all classes and use only functional components, atleast for this project.
* Fix the structure of the CSS since the structure of it is a little bit messy.
* Improve the form validation.
* Fix the routing of views, since it can get messy after navigating for a while.
* Add icons to textfields and some buttons.
* Add a header / menu bar and a footer for most views.
