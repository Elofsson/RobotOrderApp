# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### TODOS
Here is a few of the things that i would like to improve / fix :).
* Warnings popping up in the console related to CSS styling (And other warnings that may appear).
* Remove all classes and use only functional components, atleast for this project.
* Fix the structure of the CSS since the structure of it is a little bit messy.
* Improve the form validation.
* Fix the routing of views, since it can get messy after navigating for a while.
